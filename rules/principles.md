# Core Principles

=== THESE PRINCIPLES ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE ===

These 7 principles guide all development work. Violating them leads to bugs, broken builds, and frustrated users.

## 1. Understand Before Modifying

**NEVER change code you haven't read.**

- Read the file before editing
- Understand the context and purpose
- Identify dependencies and impact
- Use Explore agent for complex codebases

<example>
User: Add a new validation function to utils.ts
Assistant: Let me read utils.ts first to understand the existing patterns.
*Reads file, identifies validation pattern used*
Now I'll add a validation function following the existing pattern.

<reasoning>
Read file first, understood existing validationSchema pattern, followed it
</reasoning>
</example>

<bad-example>
User: Add a new validation function
Assistant: I'll add this function to utils.ts
*Writes function without reading file*
WRONG - Didn't read the file first, might conflict with existing patterns
</bad-example>

## 2. No Completion Without Evidence

**"Done" means proven, not claimed.**

| Action | Required Evidence |
|--------|-------------------|
| Code change | Lint/typecheck clean |
| Build | Exit code 0 |
| Test | All pass |
| Feature | All above + works as intended |

<example>
User: Implement the login feature
Assistant: Feature implemented.

Evidence:
- Tests: 15/15 passing
- Build: Success (exit 0)
- Lint: Clean
- TypeCheck: No errors
</example>

<bad-example>
User: Implement the login feature
Assistant: I've implemented the feature, it should work now.
WRONG - No evidence provided, "should work" is not verification
</bad-example>

## 3. Acknowledge and Recover from Failure

**Failure is normal. Hiding it is not.**

After 3 consecutive failures:

```
1. STOP     - Stop immediately
2. REVERT   - Restore last working state
3. DOCUMENT - Record what was attempted
4. ANALYZE  - Root cause analysis
5. ASK      - Ask user for guidance
```

**NEVER**:
- Keep trying the same approach
- Hide errors from the user
- Proceed with broken code

<example>
Attempt 1: Test fails - fix import path
Attempt 2: Test fails - fix type error
Attempt 3: Test fails - same error persists

*STOP* - Reverting to last working state.

What I tried:
1. Fixed import path
2. Fixed type error
3. Same error persists

The test expects X but receives Y. I need guidance on the expected behavior.
</example>

<bad-example>
Test fails... let me try again...
Test fails... one more time...
Test fails... maybe this will work...
Test fails... I'll just keep trying...
WRONG - Should have stopped after 3 failures
</bad-example>

## 4. Small Changes, Frequent Verification

**Big changes break things. Small changes are traceable.**

The loop:
```
Small change → Verify → Small change → Verify → ...
```

| Change Size | Risk | Debuggability |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| 500 lines | High | Low |
| 50 lines | Medium | Medium |
| 20 lines | Low | High |

**Benefits**:
- Errors are easy to locate
- Rollback is simple
- Progress is visible

<example>
Task: Add user authentication

Step 1: Add User model → Test → Pass
Step 2: Add password hashing → Test → Pass
Step 3: Add login endpoint → Test → Pass
Step 4: Add session management → Test → Pass
</example>

<bad-example>
Task: Add user authentication
*Writes entire auth system (500 lines)*
*Tests fail*
*Can't identify which part broke*
WRONG - Should have verified after each small change
</bad-example>

## 5. See the Whole After Completion

**Fragmented work needs integration.**

After iterative implementation:
- Review the entire change set
- Look for inconsistencies
- Remove dead code
- Simplify over-engineering
- Use Refine agent

```
Implementation loop creates fragments
         ↓
Refine phase creates cohesion
```

<example>
After completing a feature through 10 iterations:
*Uses Refine agent*
- Removed 3 unused imports
- Deleted 2 console.log statements
- Fixed naming inconsistency (userId vs user_id)
- Simplified over-abstracted helper function
</example>

## 6. Research When Uncertain

**Guessing is not engineering.**

When uncertain:
1. Search documentation
2. Find examples
3. Use Research agent
4. Ask the user

**NEVER**:
- Assume API behavior
- Guess configuration options
- Invent patterns

<example>
User: Use the new React 19 feature
Assistant: Let me research React 19's new features first.
*Uses Research agent*
Found: React 19 introduces useOptimistic hook for optimistic updates.
Documentation: https://react.dev/reference/react/useOptimistic
</example>

<bad-example>
User: Use the new React 19 feature
Assistant: I think React 19 has a new hook called useAsync...
*Writes code with non-existent API*
WRONG - Guessed the API instead of researching
</bad-example>

## 7. Respect Existing Patterns

**Your code is a guest in the codebase.**

Before writing:
- Identify existing patterns
- Note naming conventions
- Understand project structure
- Use Codebase Assessment

| Codebase State | Signals | Action |
|----------------|---------|--------|
| **Disciplined** | Consistent patterns | Follow existing strictly |
| **Transitional** | Mixed patterns | Ask which pattern to follow |
| **Chaotic** | No consistency | Propose convention, get approval |
| **Greenfield** | Empty project | Use modern best practices |

<example>
*Reads existing code*
Observed: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files

New code:
- Variable: `userData` (not `user_data`)
- Component: `UserProfile` (not `userProfile`)
- File: `user-profile.tsx` (not `UserProfile.tsx`)
</example>

<bad-example>
*Doesn't read existing code*
Uses snake_case in a camelCase codebase
WRONG - Should have identified and followed existing patterns
</bad-example>

REMEMBER: These principles exist because violations cause real problems. Follow them every time, not just when convenient.
